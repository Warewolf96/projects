The Project is about fixing issues with Generic Bears.

Generic Bears have the potential to be awesome, and they have started to get
their, but still require a some issues to be fixed. For eg: QuotesBear is not
reliable, AnnotationBear needs to give a better more detailed API, 
IndentationBear looks cool but is not usable yet. These bears can be found 
[here](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/tree/master/bears/general).

The task is to fix as many issues with these bears and make them as usable
as possible.

### Milestones

##### GSoC 2017 Coding Starts

 * All issues are disccused, and a general idea behind the algorithm of
 most generic bears is developed.
 * New changes to these algorithms(if required) are proposed.

##### GSoC 2017 Midterm

 * A given set of issues defined in the proposal are resolved.

##### GSoC 2017 Final

 * A given set of issues defined in the proposal are resolved.
